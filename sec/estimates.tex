\section{Critical radii and spherical quotients}\label{s:barcodes}

In this section, we utilize Gromov's concept of the filling radius and its modifications to provide estimates for the Vietoris--Rips barcodes and \(\theta\)-barcodes of Riemannian pseudomanifolds.
The primary examples analyzed include wedge sums and quotients of round spheres.

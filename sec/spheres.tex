\subsection{Spheres and their wedge sum}\label{ss:Sn}

For any integer $n \geq 1$ and real number $\rho > 0$, let $\bS^n(\rho)$ be the \defn{$n$-sphere of radius $\rho$}
\[
\bS^n(\rho) = \set{x \in \R^n \mid \bars{x} = \rho}.
\]
With the induced Riemannian metric, \(\bS^n(\rho)\) is referred to as a \defn{round sphere}.
We simplify notation writing \(\bS^n\) instead of \(\bS^n(1)\).
The constant
\[
\zeta_n = \arccos\Big(\frac{-1}{n+1}\Big),
\]
which is the diameter of an inscribed regular $(n+1)$-simplex in $\bS^n$, will play an important role.

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:critical values of Sn}

Characterizing the homotopy types of Vietoris--Rips complexes is a challenging question, even for simple spaces like the $n$-spheres.
For the circle $\bS^1$, a complete answer is provided in \cite{adamaszek2017VietorisProduct}, but for more general spheres $\bS^n$ with $n>1$, only partial results are known.

In \cite{adamaszek2018metric}, the authors introduced the Vietoris--Rips metric thickening, a metrization of the Vietoris--Rips complex that embeds the original metric space as a metric subspace. They determined the first scale parameter at which the homotopy type of the thickening of an \(n\)-sphere changes.
While this does not directly yield the homotopical radius of the \(n\)-sphere, it provides insights into its homotopy behavior and yields homological information, since the thickening shares the same homology as the original Vietoris–Rips complex \cite[Cor.~3]{gillespie2024vietoris}.

Building on the equivalence between the Kuratowski and Vietoris--Rips filtrations, the authors in \cite{lim2024vietoris} determined both the homotopical radius and the subsequent homotopy type in the Vietoris--Rips filtration of the \(n\)-sphere.

The following lemma is a consequence of these results, along with those from \cite{katz1983filling}.

\lemma
For any $m,n \in \N$ and linear cohomology operation $\theta$ we have:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \(\crit(\bS^n) = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\),
	\item \(\firstdeath{m}{\bS^n} =
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{1}{2}\zeta_n & m = n, \\
		\hfil 0 & m \neq n,
	\end{cases}\)
	\item \(\firstdeath{\theta}{\bS^n} = 0\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proof}
	(1) By \cite[Thm.~7.1]{lim2024vietoris}, for any $0 < r \leq \zeta_n$, the space $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\bS^n$, and the homotopy type of $\VR_r(\bS^n)$ changes at $\zeta_n$.
	This implies $\crit(\bS^n)=\frac{1}{2}\zeta_n$.

	\smallskip (2) According to \cite{katz1983filling}, \(\fillrad(\bS^n) = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\).
	Applying \cref{ss:beta v.s. fillrad}, we obtain \(\firstdeath{n}{\bS^n} = \frac{1}{2}\zeta_n\).
	When $m\neq n$, the statement follows from the fact that the initial space in the filtration has a trivial degree $m$ reduced homology.

	\smallskip (3) We apply a similar argument as in the $m\neq n$ case of (2). The statement follows from the fact that the initial space in the filtration has trivial $\img_\theta$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:VRSn projection}

Let \(n \in \N\) and \(r \in (0, \zeta_n]\).
From \cite[Thm.~7.1]{lim2024vietoris} we know that the spaces \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) and \(\bS^n\) have the same homotopy type for any \(n \in \N\).
We now recall from \cite{adamaszek2018metric} a natural map that can be used to realize this equivalence.

In \cite{adamaszek2018metric}, the authors introduced the concept of Vietoris–Rips metric thickenings, which endows the Vietoris–Rips complex with a new topology.
They define the \defn{canonical projection of \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\)} as the set map
\[
f_r^n \colon \VR_r(\bS^n) \to \R^{n+1} \setminus \set{0} \to \bS^n,
\]
constructed by first mapping a formal linear combination \(\sum \lambda_i x_i\) to the corresponding point \(\sum \lambda_i x_i\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\), followed by a radial projection onto \(\bS^n\).
Throughout this work, we do not distinguish between a simplicial complex and its geometric realization.

As mentioned in \cite{adamaszek2018metric}, the map $f_r^n$ is well-defined because, when $r \leq \zeta_n$, the map $\VR_r(\bS^n) \to \R^{n+1}$ misses the origin by the proof of \cite[Lemma 3]{lovasz1983self}.
Moreover, the authors proved that when \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is equipped with the metric thickening topology, the canonical projection is a homotopy equivalence.

More recently, \cite{gillespie2024vietoris} showed that the identity map between the Vietoris--Rips complex and the Vietoris--Rips metric thickening is a weak equivalence.
Consequently, the canonical projection of \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is also a weak equivalence for the usual Vietoris--Rips complex. By the Whitehead theorem, this weak equivalence between CW spaces is indeed a homotopy equivalence.
Thus, the canonical projection remains a homotopy equivalence when \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is equipped with the usual topology, as summarized by the following lemma.

\lemma
The canonical projection of the Vietoris--Rips complex \(\VR_r(\bS^n)\) is a homotopy equivalence for every $r \in (0, \zeta_n]$.

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:barcode_Sn}

We apply \cref{ss:critical values of Sn} and the barcode estimates from \cref{ss:barcode_general} to \(\bS^n\).
Using the facts that (1) the reduced homology of \(\bS^n\) has dimension one for \(m = n\) and is zero for all other values of \(m\), and (2) for any linear cohomology operation \(\theta \in \cO(\ell, m)\) with \(\ell \neq m\), \(\img \theta_{\bS^n}\) is trivial, we proceed with the estimation but omit the figure, as it is simply a special case of \cref{fig:barcodes_vs}.

\subsubsection{}\label{ss:barcodes_VS}

For $n \in \N$ and $u_1, \dots, u_n \in \N^n$, let
\[
\VS^{u_1,\dots,u_n} =
\overbrace{\bS^1\vee\dots\vee\bS^1}^{u_1} \vee\dots\vee \overbrace{\bS^n\vee\dots\vee\bS^n}^{u_n}.
\]
Using the homotopy equivalence between the Vietoris--Rips complex of a metric gluing with the wedge sum of the Vietoris--Rips complex described in \cref{ss:wedge sum}, we have the following isomorphisms of persistence modules for \(m \in \N\) and \(\theta \in \cO(\ell,m)\):
\[
\begin{split}
	\rH_m^\VR(\VS^{u_1,\dots,u_n}) &\cong \, \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \rH_m^\VR(\bS^i)^{\oplus u_i}, \\
	\img_\theta^\VR(\VS^{u_1,\dots,u_n}) &\cong \, \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \img_\theta^\VR(\bS^i)^{\oplus u_i}.
\end{split}
\]

Therefore, both the homology barcodes and \(\img_\theta\)-barcodes of \(\VR(\VS^{u_1, \dots, u_n})\) are the multiset unions of the corresponding barcodes of \(\bS^{u_i}\); see \cref{fig:barcodes_vs}.

\begin{abstract}
	This paper establishes the foundations of the theory of persistent cohomology operations, derives decomposition formulas for wedge sums and products, and proves their Gromov--Hausdorff stability.
	These results are used to construct pairs of Riemannian pseudomanifolds for which the Gromov--Hausdorff estimates derived from persistent cohomology operations are strictly sharper than those obtained using persistent homology.

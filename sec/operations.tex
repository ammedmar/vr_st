\section{Persistent Cohomology Operations}\label{s:steenrod}

The first part of this section provides a review of classical material on cohomology operations, following standard references such as \cite{steenrod1962cohomology, mosheroperations1968, may1970general}.

Subsequently, we introduce persistent invariants derived from these operations, establishing sum and product decompositions and proving a stability result for them.
